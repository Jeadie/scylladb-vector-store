## Pre-review checklist

Before submitting a PR with your patch for review, make sure it will satisfy
the following requirements:

- Your patch is split into commits. Each commit introduces one, logically
  coherent change to the codebase.
- Commit messages should clearly explain what is being changed in the commit,
  and what is the reason for the change.
- New features and bug fixes are covered with tests.
- Every commit in your patch compiles, passes static checks and passes all
  tests.
- The description of your PR explains the reason and motivation for the patch.
- If patch fixes an issue, there should be a Fixes: #XYZ line at the end of
  PR's description.

In case any of those requirements can't be met, please include the reason for
this in your PR's description. A maintainer can make an exception and merge the
PR if the reason is justified.

Review and merging

After submitting a PR which meets all criteria from the previous section, it
will be reviewed by one or more maintainers. When the maintainers become
satisfied with your contribution, one of them will merge it.
